### Credits
Thank you to:
  - github user brandenhall for his library that I used to understand better the handshaking process;
  - developers of the third party libraries included by this websocket client library: MD5, sha1 & Base64;

This library is general purpose but was made to support the muzzley arduino library (also available on github). Check http://www.muzzley.com for further reference.
